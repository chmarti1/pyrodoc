# The PYroMat documentation files

The PyroDoc repository is the home for the documentation and web materials for the PYroMat project.  The html and cgi-bin directories contain the PYroMat website files.  The poly2 directory contains a crude description of the polynomial evaluation algorithm used in the MP1 class.  More similar technical documentation is on the way.
