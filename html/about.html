<h3 id="scope" class="subtitle">Scope and purpose</h3>
<div class="section">
    <p>
    PYroMat is a Python package for conveniently retrieving the thermodynamic properties of substances.  PYroMat is and will always be free and open.  The original source data will always be fully disclosed.
    </p>
    <p>
    Providing the properties of substances is an awfully broad mandate; so we have to start somewhere.  As of version 2.0.1, PYroMat had over 390 substances, and it's very first multi-phase substance; water.  By version 2.1.0, it had over 1,000 substances with more multi-phase support, and work continues today.
    </p>
    <p>
    There are some excellent alternatives out there that do some similar things, but all of them are either for profit, have limited capabilities, are devoted to much narrower data sets, or are built to perform a specific job.  PYroMat is written entirely in Python and is designed with the intent of minimizing the clicks and keystrokes required to get data that should be available to us all.

    <h3 id="history_poem">A little poem</h3>
    <pre class="verse">
There once was a student
with work ethic prudent
she scripted to speed her work.

In Python t'was coded,
so when it was loaded,
she could all the tedium shirk.

A thermodynamic
fluid mechanic
problem she had solved.

Her colleagues were avid
she share the package
frustration to resolve.

Good, was the mood.
Researchers all cooed,
until she read her mail.

With no contradiction,
viscosity-friction;
with it her package would sail.

She furiously typed
new modules to write.
The people, they must be heard.

What thanks had it gotten?
why, STEAM she'd forgotten!
Without it, the code was absurd.

Downtrodden indeed,
she sat at the screen,
multiphase soon to add.

Though coffee was drunk
and sleepless nights sunk,
her code, it really was bad!

The syntax was rambling
no hope of unscrambling
the endless nonsensical edits.

Compatible, reverse,
a programmer's curse
no fixing - it's time to shred it.

"I'm done," she then plead.
To the airport, she fled.
"I'll fly off to someplace that's random."

Her useful creation
was once a sensation;
forgotten and now is abandoned.

Her colleagues still moan,
"Please pick up your phone!
Your software, it just isn't working."

Ye coders beware
the fate most unfair,
within all your projects is lurking.
</pre>

    <h3 id="history_story">The story behind PYroMat</h3>
    <p>
    In 2006, I needed to calculate enthalpies of lots of ideal gases for combustion modeling, and I was disappointed with my options.  I created HOT for Matlab and Octave, and it's still available from <a href="hot-tdb.sourceforge.com">Sourceforge</a> and the <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/26430-hot-thermodynamic-tools-for-matlab" target="blank">Mathworks File Exchange</a> (I haven't actively supported it in about a decade).  When I released it, there was a warm response from a community of students and researchers, but there were a number of poor implementation decisions.  About the same time, Python was gaining ground in scientific computing, so rather than improving the Matlab code, I started from scratch in Python.  I haven't updated HOT since 2010, and I've never regretted the transition.
    </p>
    <p>
    In 2015, I shared the first version on Sourceforge, and I was very proud of my cute working title for the package, "PYro."  <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Pyro4" target="blank">Pyro</a> is a popular remote object toolkit for Python, with which my working title collided.  With a nod to the intent for its future breadth, the project became PYroMat.
    </p>
    <p>
    The first release of PYroMat supported ideal gas data through two classes; <span class="code">igfit</span> and <span class="code">igtab</span>.  The <span class="code">igfit</span> class supplied properties through the so-called <a target="blank" href="http://combustion.berkeley.edu/gri_mech/data/nasa_plnm.html">NASA polynomials</a>.  Meanwhile, <span class="code">igtab</span> objects simply performed interpolation on tabulated data.
    </p>
    <p>
    In version 1, I experimented with a number of different strategies for providing inverse property routines (e.g. calculating temperature from entropy and pressure).  I tried exposing a generic iterative inversion routine called <span class="code">psolve</span>, but it was awfully inefficient and it had predictable convergence problems near phase transitions.  I finally settled on class-specific methods like <span class="code">T_s()</span>.  They're much faster, more stable, and because they are specific to a class, I can keep improving them without having to re-validate their behavior over the ENTIRE data set.
    </p>
    <p>
    At the close of 2017, version 2.0.1 marked a total transition to the <a target="blank" href="http://webbook.nist.gov/cgi/cbook.cgi?ID=C7732185&Mask=1#Thermo-Gas">Shomate Equation</a> for ideal gas data used by the NIST webbook, which I instantly regretted.  The <span class="code">ig</span> class still implements a number of species using the Shomate Equation, but I much prefer the old NASA polynomials, which are provided by the <span class="code">ig2</span> class.  NIST does great work, but their data were more restrictive in temperature range for some important species (like water), and there were some irritating discontinuities in the specific heat curves.
    </p>
    <p>
    In 2018, the first multi-phase substances found their debut in PYroMat, and I began experimenting with different back-end codes.  Through to 2019, there were many minor revisions that mostly included the release of new substances.
    </p>
    <p>
    After a lengthy delay, and encouraged by much correspondence, I finally released version 2.1.0 in 2021, which made a number of important improvements to back-end numerical methods, added a number of new multi-phase substances, and finally exceeded 1,000 total substances.  With more substances came better methods to search them; the <span class="code">info()</span> function was improved as well, allowing users to search for substances by class, collection, atomic contents, name, and more.
    </p>

    <h3 id="history_logo">Logo</h3>
    <p>
    The PYroMat logo is entirely thanks to the wonderful and talented <a href="https://www.behance.net/janetmontgomery">Janet Montgomery</a>.  I mentioned to her that the package needed an icon, and before I had time to think I had a multitude of options of every color and shape.  Together, we whittled it down to a snake's head combined with a flame to represent the union of Python and thermal properties.  Thanks, Janet.
    </p>

<h3 class="subtitle">Future plans</h3>
<div class="section">
    <p>
    My first priority is to broaden the number of multi-phase substances supported.  As of version 2.1.0, only five were supported (R134a, CH<sub>4</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O, and N<sub>2</sub>).  Now that the <span class="code">mp1</span> class is mature with stable numerical tools, the work required to add these sophisticated models should be much less than in the past.
    </p>
    <p>
    I would like to add viscosity, heat transfer, and other transport models to the ideal gas and possibly the multi-phase classes.  This has long been a goal of mine, but so far people have not been requesting it.
    </p>
    <p>
    One of these days, I will finally implement an integrated graphical user interface (GUI).  I have no plans to fold it into the primary package, because it would require prerequisites that many users would never need.  However, especially for those who teach using PYroMat, a GUI that could be installed and maintained just as easily as the base package would be a powerful tool.
