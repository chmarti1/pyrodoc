A to do list for future PYro releases

* Better in-line documentation!
A user familiar with Python and the foundations of thermodynamics should be able to import the package and use it without any prior reading on the organization of the package.

* Refrigerants
More multi-phase substances like refrigerants.  Maybe copy data from CoolProp?

* Better psolve() implementation
Implement a 1D solver?  Implement a 2D bisection algorithm?  What is the good way to do this?

* Solids
PVC, steels, aluminum, brass, tungsten, copper
Implement as a function of T and p?  Could get weird.

* Tools for visualization
Making beautiful plots requires some advanced programming with matplotlib.  Attach a separate tool for automating it.

* Test vectorization extensively
Improve vectorization support.  Extend to multi-dimensional vectors.

* Amalgamation class
Knit together steam and H2O.  Create a generalized amalgamation class for doing that kind of thing.

* Matlab support
Elegant implementation in Matlab.
