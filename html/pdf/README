Welcome to the PYro sourceforge distribution.

The files are organized in directories by version.  In each version's directory
you will find a pyro-X.X.zip and pyro-X.X.tar.bz2 containing identical 
data, and a pyrodoc-vX.X.pdf containing detailed documentation for PYro's 
installation, configuration, use, and even how to develop for PYro.

My intent is that old versions be maintained here in perpetuity so users can 
always revert to or take code from older implementations.

As always, please leave your comments.  I'll be as responsive as I can.
