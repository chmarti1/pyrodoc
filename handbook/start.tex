\chapter{Getting started}\label{ch:start}

In this chapter, we discuss everything you should need to get your own installation of \PM\ working and providing properties.

\section{Installation}

\PM\ is distributed primarily through the Python package index (\url{https://pypi.org/}), but it can also be downloaded and installed ``manually.''  \PM\ is written in plain Python, so there is no need to compile to binaries.

\subsection{Prerequisites}

\PM\ requires NumPy (\url{https://numpy.org/}) version 1.7 or later for numerical and array support.  There are no other prerequisites.  For documentation on the custom back-end numerical routines implemented in \PM, see chapter \ref{ch:num}.
