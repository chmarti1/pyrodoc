Equations are referenced by number in paretheses, e.g. (2.3) and NOT Equation 2.3 nor Eqn. 2.3.

Figures and tables are referenced in the usual way, e.g. Figure 2.3 or Table 2.3.

References embedded in sentences should be separated by a space from the last word.

Sections and chapters should be referenced in the same manner as figures and tables, e.g. Section 2.2.3 or Chapter 2.
